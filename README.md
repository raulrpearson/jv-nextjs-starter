# jv-nextjs-starter

> The Next.js starter I use to kick things off

For now this is just an experiment. I'm thinking it might be cool to have a
standard starter to use in my projects. Presumably, this will save time and make
me more productive. On the other hand, this starter will need to be maintained.
I'm not sure it will turn out to be worth it, but let's see.

Some of the features I'm considering:

- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- ESLint, Prettier, Husky and Jest
- Opinions in file hierarchy/structure

## Usage

You can use this starter with
[create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app):

```shell
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/raulrpearson/jv-nextjs-starter <folder_for_your_project>
```

After that, you'll probably want to edit your `package.json` fields to reflect
your project data.
